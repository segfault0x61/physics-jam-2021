# Physics Jam 2021
This project was made for the 2020 [#8bitstoinfinity](https://itch.io/jam/8bti-physics-jam) Physics jam. 
## About
The theme for this jam was **Switch**, and to accomade for this theme I created a game with platforming mechanics with artificial gravity that the player generates as they move and jump around the map to reach keys and complete the level. This game was created using pure Javascript with only p5.js as the only external library, the code doesn't look the best but I tried to replicate the physics as accurate as possible without relying on something like Box2D or Matter.js
